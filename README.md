# Intruder Alert System Using Motion Sensors and GSM Module ðŸš¨ðŸ”’

This project involves the development of a cost-effective security system designed to detect unauthorized entry and send real-time alerts using motion sensors and GSM technology.

## Project Overview

Completed in April 2024, the Intruder Alert System employs Arduino Uno, PIR sensors, and a GSM module to enhance security through immediate notifications.

### Key Features
- **Unauthorized Entry Detection:** Utilizes PIR sensors to detect motion and trigger alerts.
- **Real-Time SMS Alerts:** Sends instant SMS notifications to the user upon detecting unauthorized entry.
- **Remote Monitoring:** Allows users to monitor the system from a distance, enhancing security.

### Technologies Used
- **Arduino Uno:** The main microcontroller for processing data from sensors.
- **PIR Sensors:** Used for motion detection.
- **GSM Module:** Enables sending SMS alerts to the user.

### Future Enhancements
- Potential for expanding the system with additional sensors (e.g., door/window sensors) for increased security.
- Integration with IoT platforms for remote access and monitoring via mobile applications.

## Insights
- Designed with a focus on cost-effectiveness and ease of use, this system provides a practical solution for home security.
